        Do the D.A.N.C.E
        1234, fight!
        Stick to the B.E.A.T
        Get ready to ignite
        You were such a P.Y.T
        Catching all the lights
        Just easy as A.B.C
        That's how we make it right.

        Do the D.A.N.C.E
        Stick to the B.E.A.T
        Just easy as A.B.C

        Do the Dance
        Do. the. Dance.

        My Little Pony, My Little Pony
        Ahh ahh ahh ahhh...
        My Little Pony
        I used to wonder what friendship could be
        My Little Pony
        Until you all shared its magic with me
        Big adventure
        Tons of fun
        A beautiful heart
        Faithful and strong
        Sharing kindness,
        It's an easy feat
        And magic makes it all complete
        You have my little ponies
        Do you know you're all my very best friends?

        I like big butts and I can not lie
        You other brothers can't deny
        That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
        And a round thing in your face
        You get sprung

        And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
        Just to get it all out, what's in my head
        And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
        And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
        And I take A deep breath and I get real high
        And I scream from the top of my lungs,
        What's goin' on
        And I say hey, hey, hey, hey hey
        Hey, hey, hey
        I said hey, what's goin' on?
